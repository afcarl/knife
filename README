Refine is a 3D tetrahedral grid adaptation framework. It is
implemented with an object-oriented flavor in the C language.  Most
functionality is wrapped into Ruby scripting language extensions
<http://www.ruby-lang.org/> for use in test first programming and unit
testing. See the README.EXT file in the Ruby distribution for details
on ruby extensions. 

The refine library can be called by FUN3D <http://fun3d.larc.nasa.gov/>
to perform adaptation with a parallel execution scheme.

CAD geometry access is facilitated with the NASA Langley Geometry
Laboratory SDK <http://geolab.larc.nasa.gov/>, which assess CAD
information with the CAPRI API
<http://raphael.mit.edu/capri/docs.html>.

MesherX is an advancing layer mixed-element mesher
<http://www.scorec.rpi.edu/~garimell/thesis/THESIS-FULL.PDF> that
interacts with the SDK to rebuild the inviscid portions of the grid.

See the INSTALL file for build instructions.

in the AUTHORS file for help or more information.
