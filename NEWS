Tuesday, June 22, 2010: At version 1.2.0, fun3d-10.7-38759 or later
Now will ignore zero area cut surface triangles during normal and area
computations. Added a more general .tri surface file reader that
auto-detects ASCII and either little-endian or big-endian Fortran
unformatted. 

Thursday, April 22, 2010: At version 1.1.0, fun3d-10.7-38759 or later
Use all surfaces faces when faces keyword is missing from [project].knife
Added knife_cut_surface_dim_ and knife_cut_surface_ to API to request cut
surface geometry as it was used.  added subtriangle parent information
for cut surfaces (knife_surface_sens_), cut edges
(knife_between_poly_sens_), and cut boundaries (knife_boundary_sens_)
to build sensitivity

Thursday, January 3, 2008: At version 1.0.0, FUN3D r25733 or later 
passes triangle_tag and precomupted normal and area. Added
