	* src/surface.c (surface_from) store face tag for each triangle's
	 boundary_face_index.

2007-04-12 16:40 Mike Park  <mike.park@nasa.gov>

	* src/mask.c (mask_centroid_volume_contribution) repaired calculation
	of xyz location with barycentric coordinates that caused wild errors
	in centroid and volume calculations.

2007-04-12 16:40 Mike Park  <mike.park@nasa.gov>

	* src/mask.c (mask_centroid_volume_contribution) repaired calculation
	of xyz location with barycentric coordinates that caused wild errors
	in centroid and volume calculations.

	* src/intersection.c (intersection_x,intersection_y,
	intersection_z,intersection_xyz) use triangle uvw interpolation to
	find xyz instead of segment t interpolation for beter consistency.

2007-04-11  9:35 Mike Park  <mike.park@nasa.gov>

	* src/poly.c (poly_surface_subtri,poly_boundary_subtri) provide
	accurate triangle-based area and normal calculations.
	* src/knife_fortran.c (knife_surface_triangles_,knife_boundary_triangles_)
	to include precomupted normal and area, reflected in fun3d-24275.

2007-04-10 16:04 Mike Park  <mike.park@nasa.gov>

	* src/subtri.c (subtri_reference_area) now returns the area as a
	portion of triangle area.

2007-04-10 13:28 Mike Park  <mike.park@nasa.gov>

	* src/poly.c (poly_subtri_between) provide accurate triangle-based
	area and normal calculations.
	* src/knife_fortran.c (knife_triangles_between_poly_) to include
	precomupted normal and area, reflected in fun3d-24233.

2007-04-10 10:10 Mike Park  <mike.park@nasa.gov>

	* src/triangle.c (triangle_area_normal) added.
	* src/triangle.c (subtri_normal_area,subtri_centroid_volume_contribution) deleted.
	* src/mask.c (mask_centroid_volume_contribution) refactored to use
	triangle normal and area, not subtri_centroid_volume_contribution.
	to reduce normal calculation error for small subtri.

2007-04-10  8:45 Mike Park  <mike.park@nasa.gov>

	* Made 0.8.1 Release. Accounted for fun3d-23948 c2n index flip.

2007-03-21 16:58 Mike Park  <mike.park@nasa.gov>

	* src/knife_fortran.c (knife_volume_) to account for fun3d-23948 c2n
	index flip.
	* src/primal.c (primal_copy_volume) to account for fun3d-23948 c2n
	index flip.

2007-02-26 12:30 Mike Park  <mike.park@nasa.gov>

	* src/knife_fortran.c (knife_ntriangles_between_poly_) create a
	missing poly to represent dual when missing.

2007-02-07 12:08 Mike Park  <mike.park@nasa.gov>

	* Made 0.8.0 Release. Multiple cut regions complete. Tag before
	attempting speedup.

2006-12-26 19:45 Mike Park  <mike.park@nasa.gov>

	* Made 0.7.1 Release. Tagged before adding multiple cut regions.

2006-12-18 16:10 Mike Park  <mike.park@nasa.gov>

	* src/knife_fortran.c (knife_make_dual_required_) Added code to
	ensure that duals are flagged when needed for faces.

2006-12-12 11:20 Mike Park  <mike.park@nasa.gov>

	* Made 0.7.0 Release. Added code to release resources. 
	FUN3D version 22043.
